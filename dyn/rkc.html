                    One of the most common type of motion is constrained motion, where an object is
                    restricted to move in a certain way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally, a point constrained to move in a specific direction obeys the following equation:

                    The above equation is difficult to apply to a system with a collection of points or particles.
                    It is not the only way to derive constraint equations. For example, rigid body kinematics
                    equations (also known as relative motion equations) are derived using the definition of a rigid body. Namely,
                    the distance and angles between all points remain constant. See <a href="rkg.html#rkg-er">rigid body relations</a>.
                    It is often best to look at examples of constrained motion to see how constraint equations are differentiated to obtain
                    velocity and acceleration.

                <p>
                    We will begin with a simple example of a rod leaning against a wall constrained to maintain contact with the wall and ground.

                                A uniform rod leaning against a wall has a fixed length of $\ell = 10 \rm\ m$. 
                                The bottom of the rod at point $P$ is $8 \rm\ m$ from the wall. 
                                Point $P$ is moving away from the wall at a speed of $6 \rm\ m/s$. 
                                The rod maintains contact with the wall and ground at all times.
                                What is $\vec{v}_Q$ of point $Q$, the point at the top of the ladder?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="envContainer solution">
                            <div class="envBody">
                                <p>
                                    To solve this, note the question states that the rod's length is fixed, and is not permitted to
                                    lose contact with the wall and ground. Therefore, 
                                    the constraint equation is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
                                    \[\begin{aligned}
                                    x_P^2 + y_Q^2 = \ell^2
                                    \end{aligned}\]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This becomes a related rates problem from calculus 1.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Differentiating with respect to time, keeping in mind the chain rule:
                                    \[\begin{aligned}
                                    2x_P\dot{x}_P + 2y_Q\dot{y}_Q = 0
                                    \end{aligned}\]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The quantity we're interested in is $\dot{y}_Q$, or $v_Q$, and $y_Q = \sqrt{\ell^2 - x_P^2}$.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Solving yields $\vec{v}_Q = -8\hat{\jmath} \rm\ m/s$.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another way to solve this is using the <a href="rkg.html#rkg-er">rigid body relations</a>,
                                    knowing that the distance and angles from the top to the bottom of the rod remains constant,
                                    which is a rigid body by definition. Using rigid body relations:
                                    \[\begin{aligned}
                                    \vec{v}_Q &amp;= \vec{v}_P + \vec\omega \times \vec{r}_{PQ} \\
                                    &amp;= \vec{v}_P + \omega_z \vec{r}_{PQ}^{\perp}
                                    \end{aligned}\]

                                    where we have two unknowns: $\vec{v}_Q$, and $\vec\omega$, and 
                                    $\vec{r}_{PQ} = -\ell \cos\theta \hat{\imath} + \ell \sin\theta \hat{\jmath} \rm\ m$,
                                    where $\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x_P}{\ell}\right)$
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    Therefore, $\vec{r}_{PQ}^{\perp} = -\ell \sin\theta \hat{\imath} - \ell \cos\theta \hat{\jmath} \rm\ m$
                                 </p>
                                <p>
                                    Expanding the vector equation into its two scalar equations yields:
                                    \[\begin{aligned}
                                    v_{Qx} &amp;= v_{Px} - \omega_z \ell \sin\theta \\
                                    v_{Qy} &amp;= v_{Py} - \omega_z \ell \cos\theta
                                    \end{aligned}\]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since the top of the rod can only move vertically, $v_{Qx} = 0$, and $\omega_z = \frac{v_{Px}}{\ell \sin\theta} \rm\ rad/s$
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since the bottom of the rod can only move horizontally, $v_{Py} = 0$, and $v_{Qy} = -\omega_z \ell \cos\theta \rm\ m/s$
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Plugging in $\omega_z$ expression:
                                    \[
                                    v_{Qy} = -\frac{v_{Px}}{\ell \sin\theta} \ell \cos\theta = -v_{Px}\cot\theta \rm\ m/s
                                    \]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Plugging in the numbers yields the same result of $\vec{v}_{Q} = -8\hat{\jmath} \rm\ m/s$.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Note in the rigid body relations method, we implicitly used the constraint equation for a point. Namely,
                                    we know that the top of the rod can only move vertically, so $\vec{v}_Q \cdot \hat{n}_Q = 0$, where $\hat{n}_Q = \hat{\imath}$
                                    and $\vec{v}_P \cdot \hat{n}_P = 0$, where $\hat{n}_P = \hat{\jmath}$.

                    Interestingly, the sliding rod problem reveals a paradox that will be explored further in these pages.

                                Consider the compound pulley system shown, consisting of two massless pulleys $A, B$. Pulley $A$ is free to
                                move vertically, and pulley $B$ is fixed to the top. The two pulleys are connected by an inextensible, massless rope.
                                One block of mass $m_1$ is connected to pulley $A$ by a string, and another block of mass $m_2$ is hanging from the
                                rope connecting the two pulleys. Assume the pulleys' radii are negligbile. 
                                If $m_2$ moves downwards at a velocity $v_2 = 6 \rm\ m/s$ and acceleration $a_2 = 2 \rm\ m/s^2$, what are

                                    If the rope's length remains constant, we need to choose a reference line to relate the distances of
                                    the masses to that reference line and set it equal to the rope's length. The following figure shows
                                    the reference line, as well as the masses' distances from that line.

                                    Note that $y_1$ is only extended to pulley $A$. Since the pulleys are massless, they will not rotate,
                                    and therefore $m_1$ and pulley $A$ will translate vertically together at the same rate.

                                <p>
                                    Now, we can write the total length of the rope in terms of those two distances. The total length of the rope, $L$ will be:
                                    \[
                                    2y_1 + y_2 = L
                                    \]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>2. Differentiate once or twice with respect to time to obtain $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{a}$ relationships.</strong>
                                    Now, we can take two derivatives with respect to time to obtain the relationship between the speeds $v_1, v_2$, and
                                    the accelerations $a_1, a_2$.
                                    \[\begin{aligned}
                                    2v_1 + v_2 &amp;= 0 \\
                                    2a_1 + a_2 &amp;= 0 
                                    \end{aligned}\]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Notice that the length of the rope does not matter ultimately. This makes sense,
                                    as the length of the rope is constant, and therefore does not change with time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>3. Solve for the desired quantity.</strong>
                                    We are interested in both the velocity and acceleration of $m_1$.
                                    <br>
                                    Solving for $\vec{v}_1 = \frac{-\vec{v}_2}{2} = 3\hat{\jmath}\rm\ m/s$ and $\vec{a}_1 = \frac{-\vec{a}_2}{2} = \hat{\jmath}\rm\ m/s^2$ 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Reflecting on the result obtained, it makes sense. The distance $m_1$ has to travel up the rope is two times
                                    more than the length $m_2$ has to travel. We can also draw a free-body diagram to understand
                                    this result further. We will return to this example further down when constraint forces are covered.

                    If an object is constrained to move in a specific direction, by Newton's second law, there must be
                    forces or moments preventing the movement of the object in that direction. Those are called <em>constraint forces</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The approach to solving for constraint forces is the same approach to solve for any forces/moments that are not constraint forces. Namely,
                    drawing a free body diagram, and applying Newton's equations. See <a href="rep.html#rep-ep">the solution procedure with Newton's equations.</a>

                                A uniform rod of mass $m$ and length $\ell$ is leaning against a wall at an angle $\phi$ as shown.
                                The rod starts sliding under the influence of gravity $\vec{g}$.
                                What are the expressions of the constraint forces $\vec{F}_P, \vec{F}_Q$ that ensure the rod maintains contact with the wall
                                and ground at all times?

                                    We will begin by drawing a free body diagram on the rod.

                                <p>
                                    Note that due to the constraint placed on the rod, point $P$ can only slide along the ground
                                    and therefore by <a href="#rkc-pc">#rkc-pc</a>, $\vec{F}_P$ acts vertically. Similarly for point $Q$, $\vec{F}_Q$
                                    acts horizontally.

                                <p>
                                    Applying Newton's second law:
                                    \[
                                    \sum \vec{F}_{ext} = m\vec{a}_C
                                    \]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Breaking it up into the scalar equations. Note we will use $\ddot{x}_C, \ddot{y}_C$ to denote
                                    the acceleration of the center of mass $C$ in each direction.
                                    \[\begin{aligned}
                                    F_Q &amp;= m\ddot{x}_C \\
                                    F_P - mg &amp;= m\ddot{y}_C
                                    \end{aligned}\]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now we can apply the solution procedure detailed in <a href="#rkc-cp">#rkc-cp</a> to find
                                    the acceleration of point $C$. Due to our constraint, the following applies at all times:
                                    \[
                                    x_C = \frac{\ell}{2}\sin\phi \qquad \qquad y_C = \frac{\ell}{2}\cos\phi
                                    \]

                                <p>
                                    Differentiating twice, keeping in mind the chain rule:
                                    \[\begin{aligned}
                                    \ddot{x}_C &amp;= -\frac{\ell\dot\theta^2}{2}\sin\phi + \frac{\ell\ddot\theta}{2}\cos\phi  \\
                                    \ddot{y}_C &amp;= -\frac{\ell\dot\theta^2}{2}\cos\phi - \frac{\ell\ddot\theta}{2}\sin\phi
                                    \end{aligned}\]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Plugging into Newton's second law equations and solving for each constraint force yields:
                                    \[\begin{aligned}
                                    F_Q &amp;= -\frac{m\ell\dot\theta^2}{2}\sin\phi + \frac{m\ell\ddot\theta}{2}\cos\phi \\
                                    F_P &amp;= -\frac{m\ell\dot\theta^2}{2}\cos\phi - \frac{m\ell\ddot\theta}{2}\sin\phi + mg
