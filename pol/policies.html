					<h3><strong><a id="Academic integrity" name="Academic integrity">Academic integrity, harassment, and
								discrimination</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>Academic integrity infractions, harassment, and discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.
						See the University&#39;s <a href="http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/">Student Code</a>,
						<a href="http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html">Article 1, Part
							4</a> and the <a href="http://oeoa.illinois.edu/campusconduct.html">Campus Conduct
							Policy</a>. Please report any concerns immediately to your professor.</p>

					<p>Academic integrity infractions <strong>will be dealt with using the most stringent available
							counter-measures.</strong> All infractions are documented through the campus-wide FAIR
						database, that remains part of the student&#39;s permanent record. All infractions in this
						database will be referred to the <a
							href="http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/student_discipline/"><strong>Senate
								Committee on Student Discipline</strong></a> for review and potential additional
						sanctions. Typical pentalties in TAM 2XX courses for academic infractions include dropping one
						course letter grade. Students have been expelled from the university for cheating.</p>

					<p>Infractions include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, and assisting others in a
						manner not prescribed or allowed for in the original assignment or directions. Notably, for
						homework assignments, students are encouraged and allowed to work together. The philosophy is
						that homeworks are <em>formative</em> assessments, meaning they are intended to foster learning.
						This is in contrast to <em>summative</em> assessments, including quizzes and exams, that measure
						individual student mastery of course concepts, for which students are of course forbidden from
						assisting each other.</p>

					<p>Computer-based testing deserves special mention. This testing is typically given across multiple
						days. <strong>During the entire time period of testing, students are strictly forbidden from
							discussing any aspect of the test/quiz whatsoever with other students.</strong> This
						includes specifics of questions, general aspects of questions, comments on the difficulty of the
						quiz, etc. This policy is strictly enforced to preserve the integrity of the computer-based
						testing.</p>


					<h3><a id="CBTF" name=""><strong>Computer-Based Testing Facility:</strong></a></h3>

					<p>This course uses the College of Engineering Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF) for its
						quizzes and exams: <a href="https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/">
							https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu</a>.</p>

					<p>The policies of the CBTF are the policies of this course, and academic integrity infractions
						related to the CBTF are infractions in this course.</p>

					<p>If you have accommodations identified by the Division of Rehabilitation-Education Services (DRES)
						for exams, please take your Letter of Accomodation (LOA) to the CBTF proctors in person before
						you make your first exam reservation. The proctors will advise you as to whether the CBTF
						provides your accommodations or whether you will need to make other arrangements with your
						instructor.</p>

					<p>Any problem with testing in the CBTF <strong>must</strong> be reported to CBTF staff at the time
						the problem occurs. If you do not inform a proctor of a problem during the test then you
						<strong>forfeit</strong> all rights to redress.</p>


					<h3><a id="Contact" name="Contact"><strong>Contact and obtaining help:</strong></a></h3>

					<p>The two main ways to obtain help are online at Piazza, or in person at the Grainger office hours.
						You can also speak with your professor briefly after lecture. Please do not send email directly
						to CAs, TAs or professors for routine help or absences. &nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong><a id="Piazza" name="Piazza">Online forum (Piazza)</a>:</strong></p>

					<p>This class uses <a href="https://piazza.com/illinois/spring2019/tam251">Piazza</a> for ALL
						communications between the instructor, TAs, CAs, and students. Students should not communicate
						with instructors via email. This is so we can ensure a faster response and keep everyone
						informed about what&#39;s going on.</p>

					<p>Students are encouraged to post public messages on Piazza (&quot;Post to Entire Class&quot;). If
						you like, you can post anonymously, but we encourage everyone to use their name because it makes
						a friendlier and more welcoming environment. We will never judge anyone for asking anything on
						Piazza, and you will see professors, TAs, and CAs making mistakes and saying stupid things as
						well!</p>

					<p>You can use the private feature on Piazza by posting a message visible only to the Instructors.
						In this, you must type &quot;Instructors&quot;, instead of sending a message to a specific TA or
						instructor. Again, this helps to ensure that you get a prompt response.</p>


					<h3><strong><a id="Gradebook" name="Gradebook">Gradebook</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>All assessment scores are stored on Compass2g. Note that we are only using this website for grade
						reporting. All other class-related information will be posted only to the official class website
						or Piazza. Any errors in grade reporting appearing on Compass2g must be reported to
						&quot;Instructors&quot; via Piazza within 2 weeks of the due date of the assessment item or by
						the last day of class, whichever is earlier.</p>

					<h3><strong:><a id="FinalGrades" name="FinalGrades">Final grades</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>The total score&nbsp;<em>s</em>&nbsp;corresponds to final grades as follows.</p>

					<table style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">

					<h3><a id="Lectures" name="Lectures"><strong>Lectures:</strong></a></h3>

					<p>Prompt and regular attendance at lectures is essential for your comprehension and success in the
						course.</p>

					<h3><strong><a id="iClickers" name="iClickers">iClickers</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>Short quizzes are conducted during lectures using iClickers (75% participation, 25% correctness).
						An iClicker remote can be purchased from any of the bookstores, and must be registered on
						Compass, under the tab &quot;Register i&gt;clicker&quot;. <strong>You need to register your
							iClicker by the end of Week 2, when the iClicker roster will be synced for the last
							time.</strong> The first iClicker use for credit will take place in Week 2 of the semester.
						Your lowest three scores will be dropped. These drop should be reserved for unexpected
						occurrences such as sickness or a family emergency.</p>

					<h3><strong><a id="Quiz" name="Quiz"></a></strong><strong>Computer-based quizzes:</strong></h3>

					<p>You will have 6&nbsp;total online quizzes using the PrairieLearn system. You<strong> will not be
							allowed </strong> to use notes, textbooks or electronic devices such as laptops or cell
						phones. Solutions will not be posted. All quizzes will be held in the Computer-Based Testing
						Facility (CBTF). Make sure to check the <a href="https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/"> CBTF</a>
						website to get information about the facility and what you need to do to sign-up for your quiz.
						Each quiz grade is determined from the following formula: <strong>max([First Try, 1/3*(First
							Try) + 2/3*(Quiz Retry)]).</strong></p>

					<p>If you have an excused absence for the quiz, then you will take the assessment at a later date,
						or make other arrangements at the discretion of the instructor.</p>

					<p><strong><a id="Quiz review policy" name="Quiz review policy" style="background-size: 16px;">Quiz
								review policy</a></strong></p>

					<p>TAM 251 offers Quiz review sessions for some of the weekly quizzes. You must sign up for a review
						slot through the CBTF scheduler page.&nbsp;You will have the opportunity to sit at a CBTF
						computer and review your entire quiz from the previous week,&nbsp;as well as your scanned
						scratch paper from the quiz (if you turned it in after you finished your quiz). TAs will be
						available to help analyze your quiz with you if you wish. <strong>TAM 251 does not offer
							regrades of quizzes during this session.</strong></p>

					<p><u>Please note:</u> Quiz review gives you the opportunity to see your specific quiz instance,
						with the specific numbers for your question, and review it with the TA. If you visit TA or
						Professor office hours, we are always happy discuss&nbsp;a question you saw on the quiz as you
						remember it, and you may take all the notes you wish at this time, and keep them&nbsp;- but
						review of specific quiz instances can only be accommodated during the quiz review sesion.</p>


					<h3><strong><a id="Discussion" name="Discussion">Discussion sections</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>Discussion sections start in Week 1 of semester, with the schedule below. Prompt and regular
						attendance at your discussion section is required. You <strong>must</strong> attend only the
						discussion section in which you are enrolled. You will not receive a grade for the worksheet if
						you attend the wrong discussion section.</p>

					<p>Most discussion sessions will consist of a group worksheet exercise, which is a high-energy and
						efficient 50-minute learning experience. Students will be placed in permanent groups of three to
						four people during the third week of classes. <strong>If you are more than 5 minutes late to a
							discussion session then you will not receive credit for the section.</strong> All members of
						the group should be working together as a team. The TAs and CAs will be evaluating team work,
						problem-solution skills and interpretation of the problem.</p>

					<p>There are two main goals for the discussion worksheets:</p>

					<ol>
						<li><strong>Gain experience in team-work.</strong> This is a critical skill in all areas of
							engineering, from large-scale industrial projects to academic research. Working productively
							in teams is a skill that must be learned just like math or physics, and regular practice is
							essential. Often you will have to work with people who you do not especially like, or who
							you find it difficult to work with. It is important to lean how to manage these situations
							so that the important work is still accomplished.</li>
						<li><strong>Apply engineering concepts to real-world problems.</strong> Each worksheet focuses
							on a real-world problem that you will have to use your engineering skills to solve. This
							will include using the material from class, but also knowledge from previous engineering,
							math, and science classes. You will also have to think like an engineer, and understand when
							to make approximations, how to judge the appropriateness of different models, and which
							mathematics and physics is most useful for a given engineering problem.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>We also hope that these discussion worksheets will help you to meet other engineering students
						and we encourage you to get together outside of lectures and discussions to work collaboratively
						on homeworks and exam study.</p>


					<h3><strong><a id="Homework" name="Homework">Online homeworks</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>Weekly online homeworks will be assigned via <a
							href="https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu">PrairieLearn</a>. Each assignment is due at
						11:59pm on the assigned due date. Due dates are available inside PrairieLearn. These assignments
						place an emphasis on <strong>mastery</strong>. The idea is to keep doing questions until you
						master the underlying concept or method. Once you do, you should be able to answer these
						questions very quickly.</p>

					<p>The way this works in PrairieLearn is that each question has a value, a point total, and a point
						maximum. If you answer a question correctly, two things happen:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The point total increases by the value, until you reach the point maximum.</li>
						<li>The value increases (2x, 3x, 4x, etc.).</li>
						<li>The value increases (2x, 3x, 4x, etc.).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If you answer a question incorrectly, one thing happens:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The value goes back to what it was originally (1x).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This system rewards repeated correct answers, which tend to demonstrate mastery. There is no
						penalty (other than resetting the value) for answering a question incorrectly, so don&#39;t be
						afraid to submit an answer. Similarly, don&#39;t be afraid to keep doing a question after you
						reach the point maximum - your point total with never go down!</p>

					<p>If you click on the &quot;?&quot; just to the right of the line about available credit,
						you&#39;ll see all the dates associated with this homework. In particular, it says:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>you can receive 100% until Main End Date</li>
						<li>you can receive 80% until Extended End Date(two days later)</li>
						<li>you can receive 0%, but can keep doing problems as practice for the rest of the semester.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Note that your score will never go down. For example, if you achieve 90% by the Main End Date,
						you won&#39;t be able to increase your score after that time, but you won&#39;t be penalized for
						not reaching 100% - your score will remain 90% forever. On the other hand, if you achieve only
						70% by the Main End Date you will be able to increase your score after that time (to a maximum
						of 80%) until the Extended End Date.</p>

					<h3><strong><a id="Special accommodations" name="Special accommodations"> Special
								accommodations</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>To obtain disability-related academic adjustments or accommodations, students with disabilities
						must contact their professor and <a href="http://disability.illinois.edu/">Disability Resources
							and Educational Services (DRES)</a> as soon as possible. Students who require special
						accommodations for exams should schedule to take their exam at DRES, and DRES staff will
						communicate with the professor to organize the exam. There is no need to inform the professor
						about this in advance.</p>

					<p>The use of Piazza should not replace the in-person Office Hours time, since some questions cannot
						be fully addressed via an online forum.</p>

					<h3><strong><a id="FinalExam" name="FinalExam">Final Exam</a>:</strong></h3>

					<p>The final exam will be held in the CBTF during finals week, and will be cumulative (covering all
						course material).</p>
