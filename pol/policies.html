<h3><strong><a id="Academic integrity" name="Academic integrity">Academic integrity, harassment, and discrimination</a>:</strong></h3>

<p>Academic integrity infractions, harassment, and discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated. See the University&#39;s <a href="http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/">Student Code</a>, <a href="http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html">Article 1, Part 4</a> and the <a href="http://oeoa.illinois.edu/campusconduct.html">Campus Conduct Policy</a>. Please report any concerns immediately to your professor.</p>

<p>Academic integrity infractions <strong>will be dealt with using the most stringent available counter-measures.</strong> All infractions are documented through the campus-wide FAIR database, that remains part of the student&#39;s permanent record. All infractions in this database will be referred to the <a href="http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/student_discipline/"><strong>Senate Committee on Student Discipline</strong></a> for review and potential additional sanctions. Typical pentalties in TAM 2XX courses for academic infractions include dropping one course letter grade. Students have been expelled from the university for cheating.</p>

<p>Infractions include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, and assisting others in a manner not prescribed or allowed for in the original assignment or directions. Notably, for homework assignments, students are encouraged and allowed to work together. The philosophy is that homeworks are <em>formative</em> assessments, meaning they are intended to foster learning. This is in contrast to <em>summative</em> assessments, including quizzes and exams, that measure individual student mastery of course concepts, for which students are of course forbidden from assisting each other.</p>

<p>Computer-based testing deserves special mention. This testing is typically given across multiple days. <strong>During the entire time period of testing, students are strictly forbidden from discussing any aspect of the test/quiz whatsoever with other students.</strong> This includes specifics of questions, general aspects of questions, comments on the difficulty of the quiz, etc. This policy is strictly enforced to preserve the integrity of the computer-based testing.</p>


<h3><a id="CBTF" name=""><strong>Computer-Based Testing Facility:</strong></a></h3>

<p>This course uses the College of Engineering Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF) for its quizzes and exams: <a href="https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/"> https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu</a>.</p>

<p>The policies of the CBTF are the policies of this course, and academic integrity infractions related to the CBTF are infractions in this course.</p>

<p>If you have accommodations identified by the Division of Rehabilitation-Education Services (DRES) for exams, please take your Letter of Accomodation (LOA) to the CBTF proctors in person before you make your first exam reservation. The proctors will advise you as to whether the CBTF provides your accommodations or whether you will need to make other arrangements with your instructor.</p>

<p>Any problem with testing in the CBTF <strong>must</strong> be reported to CBTF staff at the time the problem occurs. If you do not inform a proctor of a problem during the test then you <strong>forfeit</strong> all rights to redress.</p>


<h3><a id="Contact" name="Contact"><strong>Contact and obtaining help:</strong></a></h3>

<p>The two main ways to obtain help are online at Piazza, or in person at the Grainger office hours. You can also speak with your professor briefly after lecture. Please do not send email directly to CAs, TAs or professors for routine help or absences. &nbsp;</p>


<h3><strong><a id="Gradebook" name="Gradebook">Gradebook</a>:</strong></h3>

<p>All assessment scores are stored on Compass2g. Note that we are only using this website for grade reporting. All other class-related information will be posted only to the official class website or Piazza. Any errors in grade reporting appearing on Compass2g must be reported to &quot;Instructors&quot; via Piazza within 2 weeks of the due date of the assessment item or by the last day of class, whichever is earlier.</p>


<h3><a id="Lectures" name="Lectures"><strong>Lectures:</strong></a></h3>

<p>Prompt and regular attendance at lectures is essential for your comprehension and success in the course.</p>


<h3><strong><a id="Special accommodations" name="Special accommodations"> Special accommodations</a>:</strong></h3>

<p>To obtain disability-related academic adjustments or accommodations, students with disabilities must contact their professor and <a href="http://disability.illinois.edu/">Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES)</a> as soon as possible. Students who require special accommodations for exams should schedule to take their exam at DRES, and DRES staff will communicate with the professor to organize the exam. There is no need to inform the professor about this in advance.</p>
