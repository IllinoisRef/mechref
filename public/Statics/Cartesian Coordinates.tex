\subsection{Right Hand Rule}

The Cartesian system is a "right-handed" coordinate system, which means that we can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the $x, y$ and $z$ axes. In 3D the $x, y, z$ axes are oriented in right-handed order, so that fingers curling from $x$ to $y$ means the thumb points in the $z$ direction.
