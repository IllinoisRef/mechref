\section{Questions to ask Instructor}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Overall organization in categories and order of topic appearance. I followed lecture notes, which differed a little bit from current reference pages.
    \item Application sections. The ones in red need include the overall idea but I need an instructor to make the decision on what information, pictures, equations should be included in the reference page. Also:

        \begin{enumerate}
        \item In the reference page, under Application, there is a full reference page named "Four-Bar Linkages". I am not sure to which topic each subtitle should be linked. I only referenced "Example: Knee joint (constrained motion)", "Example: Suspensions with Watt's linkage (constrained motion)" to "rigid body kinematics - Constrained motion".
        \item In the reference page, under Application, there is a full reference page named "Projectiles with air resistance". I am not sure to which topic each subtitle should be linked. As for now, they are under "Applications" of "Particle Kinetics" as "Projectiles with air resistance".
\end{enumerate}
    
\end{itemize}
