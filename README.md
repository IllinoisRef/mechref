# Mechref

Currently, the website is hosted at <a href="https://mechref.org">https://mechref.org</a>. 

## Running the pages locally

Download the repo locally, either by running the `git clone` command in a terminal or by using the GitHub Desktop application.

Install all dependencies by running `npm install`.

To start the server, run the following command in the current directory (mechref) `npm run astro dev`. It should now be accessible in your browser at `localhost:4321` (unless something already occupies port 4321). Changes to the pages are automatically refresh them, and therefore changes should appear live.

Before committing, remember to create your own branch to commit your changes to. Once your are fully done adding content, simply create a pull request.
