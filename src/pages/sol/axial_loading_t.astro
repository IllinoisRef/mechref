 A rod rests freely on a smooth horizontal surface. Temperature of the rod is raised by <InlineEquation equation="\\Delta T" />. Rod elongates by an amount.

<DisplayEquation equation="\\delta_{T} = \\alpha \\Delta T L\\"></DisplayEquation>

 Linear coefficient of thermal expansion <InlineEquation equation="\\alpha" />,  <InlineEquation equation="[\\alpha] = \\frac{1}{K},\\frac{1}{Â°C},..." />. This deformation is associated with an average thermal strain:

<DisplayEquation equation="\\varepsilon_{T} = \\frac{\\delta_T}{L} = \\alpha T\\"></DisplayEquation>

    Temperature changes with statically indeterminate beam


 Initially, rod of length <InlineEquation equation="L" /> is placed between two supports at a distance <InlineEquation equation="L" /> from each other. With no internal forces, there is no stress or strain.

<DisplayEquation equation="R_{A} = R_{B} = 0\\"></DisplayEquation>
<DisplayEquation equation="R_{A} = F\\"></DisplayEquation>
                  
 After raising the temperature, the total elongation of the rod is still zero. The total elongation is given by:

<DisplayEquation equation="\\delta = \\frac{FL}{EA} + \\alpha L \\Delta T = 0\\"></DisplayEquation>

 The stress in the rod due to change in temperature is given by:
<DisplayEquation equation="\\sigma = -\\alpha E \\Delta T\\"></DisplayEquation>

<SubSubSection id="misfit_problems" title="Misfit Problems">
A misfit problem is one in which there is difference between a design distance and the manufactured length of a material. Some misfits are created intentionally to pre-strain a member. (e.g. spokes in a bicycle wheel or strings in a tennis racket). This type of problem neither modifies the equilibrium equations (1) nor the force-extension relations, (2) but the compatibility equations, (3) need to be modified.
