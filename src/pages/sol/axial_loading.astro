<p>Stress analysis very near to the point of application of load <InlineEquation equation='P' />. <strong>Saint-Venant's principle:</strong> the stress and strain produced at points in a body <em>sufficiently removed</em>* from the region of external load application will be the same as the stress and strain produced by any other applied external loading that has the same statically equivalent resultant and is applied to the body within the same region.</p>

 A rod rests freely on a smooth horizontal surface. Temperature of the rod is raised by <InlineEquation equation='\\Delta T' />. Rod elongates by an amount.

<DisplayEquation equation='\\delta_{T} = \\alpha \\Delta T L\\' />

 Linear coefficient of thermal expansion <InlineEquation equation='\\alpha' />,  <InlineEquation equation='[\\alpha] = \\frac{1}{K},\\frac{1}{Â°C},...' />. This deformation is associated with an average thermal strain:

<DisplayEquation equation='\\varepsilon_{T} = \\frac{\\delta_T}{L} = \\alpha T\\' />

    Temperature changes with statically indeterminate beam
</Image>

 Initially, rod of length <InlineEquation equation='L' /> is placed between two supports at a distance <InlineEquation equation='L' /> from each other. With no internal forces, there is no stress or strain.

<DisplayEquation equation='R_{A} = R_{B} = 0\\' />
<DisplayEquation equation='R_{A} = F\\' />
                  
 After raising the temperature, the total elongation of the rod is still zero. The total elongation is given by:

<DisplayEquation equation='\\delta = \\frac{FL}{EA} + \\alpha L \\Delta T = 0\\' />

 The stress in the rod due to change in temperature is given by:
<DisplayEquation equation='\\sigma = -\\alpha E \\Delta T\\' />

<SubSubSection title="Misfit Problems" id="misfit_problems">
A misfit problem is one in which there is difference between a design distance and the manufactured length of a material. Some misfits are created intentionally to pre-strain a member. (e.g. spokes in a bicycle wheel or strings in a tennis racket). This type of problem neither modifies the equilibrium equations (1) nor the force-extension relations, (2) but the compatibility equations, (3) need to be modified.
