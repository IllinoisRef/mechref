Take a flexible strip, such as a thin ruler, and apply equal forces with your fingers as shown. Each hand applies a couple or moment (equal and opposite forces a distance apart). The couples of the two hands must be equal and opposite. Between the thumbs, the strip has deformed into a circular arc. For the loading shown here, just as the deformation is uniform, so the internal bending <strong>moment is uniform</strong>, equal to the moment applied by each hand.

 To evaluate the maximum absolute normal stress, denoting “c” the largest distance from the neutral surface, we use:

<Image src='/mechref/Solid_Mechanics/Bending-Figures/MaxStress.png' width='2'>  <BlueText>Taken from TAM251 Lecture Notes - L6S17</BlueText></Image>

<DisplayEquation equation='\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{|M|c}{I_z}\\' />

 Note that the ratio I/c depends only upon the geometry of the cross section. This ratio is called the ELASTIC SECTION MODULUS and is denoted by S:

<DisplayEquation equation='\\sigma_{max} = \\frac{|M|}{S}\\' />
Where <DisplayEquation equation='S = \\frac{I}{c}\\' />

<SubSection title="Composite Beams /!\\ BSM: no longer covered in TAM 251, not sure if/when it is covered in ME curriculum.">

Recall that <InlineEquation equation='\\epsilon_x = -\\frac{y}{\\rho}' /> does not depend on the material properties of the beam, and is based only on the assumptions of geometry done so far.



 <strong><RedText>**Reference pages have a broken link image here**</RedText></strong>



 In non-homogeneous beams, we can no longer assume that the neutral axis passes through the centroid of the composite section. We should now determine that location…



 After obtaining the TRANSFORMED CROSS SECTION, we get
<DisplayEquation equation='\\int_{A_t}y d A_t = 0\\' />

 Therefore, the neutral axis passes through the centroid of the transformed cross section.

 Note that the widening (<InlineEquation equation='n > 1' />) or narrowing (<InlineEquation equation='n < 1' />) must be done in a direction parallel to the neutral axis of the section, since we want y-distances to be the same in the original and transformed section, so that the distance y in the flexural formula is unaltered.

<DisplayEquation equation='\\sigma_1 = -\\frac{My}{I_t}\\' />
<DisplayEquation equation='\\sigma_2 = -\\frac{nMy}{I_t}\\' />

 Validity requires stresses below proportional limit (elastic region), deformations have negligible effect on geometry, and stresses not evaluated near points of load application.
