 When a shear force is applied, it tends to cause warping of the cross section. Therefore, when a beam is subject to moments and shear forces, the <strong>cross section will not remain plane</strong> as assumed in the derivation of the flexural formula. However, we can assume that the warping due to shear is small enough to be neglected, which is particularly true for slender beams.

 Transverse loading applied to a beam results in normal and shearing stresses in transverse sections<BlueText>, as well as a bending moment. </BlueText>



 The distribution of normal and shearing stresses satisfies:

<DisplayEquation equation="\\begin{align*} &F_x = \\int\\sigma_x dA = 0 		 &M_x &= \\int(y\\tau_{xz} - z\\tau_{xy})dA=0 \\\\ &F_y = \\int\\tau_{xy} dA = -V 	 &M_y &= \\int z\\sigma_{x} dA = 0 \\\\ &F_z = \\int\\tau_{xz} dA = 0 	 &M_z &= \\int(-y\\sigma_{x})dA = M \\\\ \\end{align*}" />

 When shearing stresses are exerted on the vertical faces of an element, equal stresses must be exerted on the horizontal faces.



 Longitudinal shearing stresses must exist in any member subjected to transverse loading.

 The variation of shear flow across the section depends only on the variation of the first moment.
<DisplayEquation equation="q = \\tau t = \\frac{VQ}{I}\\" />



 For a box beam, q grows smoothly from zero at A to a maximum at C and Câ€™ and then decreases back to zero at E.

  For a wide-flange beam, the shear flow increases symmetrically from zero at A and Aâ€™, reaches a maximum at C and then decreases to zero at E and Eâ€™.
