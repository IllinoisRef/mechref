       <p> Project history </p>
       <p> The course reference pages began as part of a larger college-wide effort from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaogn Strategic Instructional Initiatives Program (SIIP).  
              The work was done as part of a Community of Practice (COPs) model involving instroctores committed to the collaborative development of educations resources.  
              Initial pages were developed by Prof. Matt West and with the formation of the COPs are under continual development and revision by a broad team of faculty, graduate assistants, and undergraduate students.</p>
       <p> The working theory of the reference pages is that they should be accessible, interactive, and engaging.   </p>
