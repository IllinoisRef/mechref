                If we have objects which are either very massive, very
                small, or moving very fast, then Newton's equations do not
                provide a good model of their motion. Instead we must use
                Einstein's equations of <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">general
                relativity</a> (for massive and fast objects) or the
                equations of <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum
                mechanics</a> (for very small objects). Unfortunately,
                these two theories cannot be used together, so we
                currently have no good models for objects which are
                simultaneously very small and very massive, such as <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_black_hole">micro

                bang</a>. Physicists are currently trying to reconcile
                general relativity with quantum mechanics by devising a
                new set of equations (sometimes called <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity">quantum

                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything">theory
                of everything</a>). Current possibilities for new
                equations include <a

    Newton's equations relate the acceleration <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{a}" /> of a point mass with mass <InlineEquation equation="m" /> to the total applied force <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{F}" /> on the mass (sum of all applied forces). They are:
    
    <DisplayEquation equation="\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}" background="True" title="Newton's equations: "/>

    There is no derivation for Newton's equations, because they are an assumed model for dynamics. We can only verify them by comparing with experimental evidence, which confirms that Newtonian dynamics are accurate for non-relativistic and non-quantum systems.

</SubSection>

<SubSubSection title="Method of assumed forces and method of assumed motion">
    Newton's equations can be used in two main ways. Either we
          know the forces and we use this to compute the acceleration
          of a mass, or we know the acceleration and use this to
          compute the forces.

        <DisplayEquation equation="\\begin{align}\\textbf{Method of assumed forces: } \\text{Know } \\vec{F} \\Longrightarrow \\text{Compute } \\vec{a} \\\\ \\textbf{Method of assumed motion: } \\text{Know } \\vec{a} \\Longrightarrow \\text{Compute } \\vec{F} \\end{align}" />

    Of course there are other possibilities from these two, such
          as knowing the vertical component of the force and the
          horizontal component of acceleration, and then computing the
          missing components of each.
        
    <Example id="rep-xf" title="Method of assumed forces">
        A cannonball of mass <InlineEquation equation="m" /> is fired from the origin with initial velocity <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{v}_0" /> and then experiences a force <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{F}_{\\rm g} = -m g \\hat{\\jmath}" /> due to gravity and a wind force <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{F}_{\\rm w} = -C_{\\rm w} \\hat{\\imath}" />. What is the motion of the cannonball as a function of time?

        <div slot="solution">
            We can use Newton's equations to find the acceleration of the cannonball, using the method of assumed forces:

            <DisplayEquation equation="\\begin{aligned} m \\vec{a} &amp;= \\vec{F}_{\\rm w} + \\vec{F}_{\\rm g} \\\\ \\vec{a} &amp;= \\frac{1}{m} \\left( - C_{\\rm w} \\hat{\\imath} - m g \\hat{\\jmath} \\right) \\end{aligned}" />
        </div>
    </Example>

    <Example id="rep-xm" title="Method of assumed motion">
        A car of mass <InlineEquation equation="m" /> is observed driving on a sinusoidal road at a constant horizontal speed <InlineEquation equation="v_0" />. The road surface has equation <InlineEquation equation="y = A \\sin(k x)" />, where <InlineEquation equation="A" /> is the amplitude and <InlineEquation equation="k" /> is the wavenumber. What is the force of the road on the car? Gravity <InlineEquation equation="g" /> acts vertically and assume no air resistance.

        <div slot="solution">
            We can determine the acceleration of the car, and then use Newton's equations and method of assumed motion to find the total force and thus the road force. First, we find the acceleration:

            <DisplayEquation equation="\\begin{aligned} x(t) &amp;= x_0 + v_0 t \\\\ \\vec{r}(t) &amp;= x(t)\\,\\hat{\\imath} + y(x(t)) \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &amp;= (x_0 + v_0 t)\\,\\hat{\\imath} + A \\sin(k x_0 + k v_0 t)\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ \\vec{a}(t) = \\ddot{\\vec{r}}(t) &amp;= - A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x_0 + k v_0 t)\\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &amp;= - A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\jmath}. \\end{aligned}" />

            Given the force of gravity <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{F}_{\\rm g} = - m g \\,\\hat{\\jmath}" /> and the road force <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{F}_{\\rm r} " />, Newton's equations give the forces as:

            <DisplayEquation equation="\\begin{aligned} \\vec{F}_{\\rm r} + \\vec{F}_{\\rm g} &amp;= m \\vec{a} \\\\ \\vec{F}_{\\rm r} &amp;= - m A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x)\\,\\hat{\\jmath} + m g \\,\\hat{\\jmath} \\\\ &amp;= m \\Big(g - A (k v_0)^2 \\sin(k x)\\Big) \\,\\hat{\\jmath},  \\end{aligned}" />

            where we have solved for the road force on the car.

        What happens when we step on the gas or brake in a car? The
        car pushes against the road to either accelerate (gas pedal)
        or decelerate (brake pedal). But how are the forces on the
        car and wheels distributed? What determines whether the
        wheels grip the road or lose traction and spin or slide?

        The simplest model of a car is to treat the entire vehicle
        as a point mass. On a <button
        class="seq-toggle:ava-fp-c:fbd">free body diagram</button>
        we have vertical force balance for a stationary car. When
        the car <button
        class="seq-step:ava-fp-c:motion:stationary">accelerates</button>,
        there is a horizontal forward force on the car, and a
        corresponding backwards horizontal force on the ground. As
        the car picks up speed, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29">air
        resistance</a> produces a backwards force. On the diagram we
        have drawn some forces offset from the center of mass, so
        that the vectors don't overlap. Because we are assuming a
        point mass model, however, all vectors are really acting at
        the same point.
      </p>
      <p>
        While cruising at a constant speed, there is a balance
        between the horizontal driving force and the drag force due
        to air resistance. When the car <button
        class="seq-step:ava-fp-c:motion:cruising">brakes</button>,
        there is a backwards force that slows the car down to a
        stop.

        Consider a spherical object, such as a baseball, moving
        through the air.  The motion of an object though a fluid is
        one of the most complex problems in all of science, and it
        is still not completely understood to this day.  One of the
        reasons this problem is so challenging is that, in general,
        there are many different forces acting on such objects,
        including:
      </p>
    <Itemize>
        <Item>gravity</Item>
        <Item>drag</Item>
        <Item>lift</Item>

        <Item>buoyancy</Item>
        <Item>bulk fluid motion, such as wind</Item>
        <Item>inertial forces, such as the centrifugal and Coriolis forces</Item>
    </Itemize>

    <p>
        In most introductory physics and dynamics courses, gravity
        is the only force that is accounted for (this is equivalent
        to assuming that the motion takes place in a vacuum).  Here
        we will consider realistic and accurate models of air
        resistance that are used to model the motion of projectiles
        like baseballs.

<SubSubSubSection title="Drag forces and drag coefficients">
    <p>
        The <em>drag force</em> is always directly opposed to the velocity of
        the object.  In vector notation,

        <DisplayEquation equation="\\vec{F}_{\\rm D} = -F_{\\rm D} \\hat{v}," />

        where <InlineEquation equation="F_{\\rm D}" /> is the magnitude of the drag force, and
        <InlineEquation equation="\\hat{v}" /> is the unit vector in the direction of the
        object's velocity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The magnitude of the drag force is
        characterized by the dimensionless <em>drag coefficient</em>
        <InlineEquation equation="C_{\\rm D}"  />, given by

        <DisplayEquation equation="C_{\\rm D} = \\frac{F_{\\rm D}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^2}," />


        where <InlineEquation equation="\\rho" /> is the density of the fluid (in this case,
        air), <InlineEquation equation="A=(1/4)\\pi D^{2}" /> is the cross-sectional area of the object, and <InlineEquation equation="v" />        is the object's speed.

<SubSubSubSection title="Drag coefficients as a function of Reynolds number">
    
    <p>
        A dimensionless parameter that is very useful in fluid
        dynamics is the Reynolds number, which is defined as

        <DisplayEquation equation="{\\rm Re} = \\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}," />

        where <InlineEquation equation="L" /> is a characteristic length for the flow (in this
        case, the diameter <InlineEquation equation="D" /> of the ball), and <InlineEquation equation="\\mu" /> is the
        dynamic viscosity of the fluid.  The Reynolds number gives a
        ratio between inertial forces and viscous forces in a fluid
        flow.  For very small Reynolds numbers, the viscous forces
        are much stronger than the inertial forces (think of trying
        to stir a cup of honey).  For very large Reynolds numbers,
        the viscous forces are negligible, and we refer to the flow
        as <em>inviscid</em> (think of stirring a cup of coffee).
      </p>
      <p>
        An important result in fluid dynamics is that the drag
        coefficient is a function only of the Reynolds number of the
        fluid flow about the object.  That is,
  
        <DisplayEquation equation="C_{\\rm D} = C_{\\rm D}({\\rm Re})." />

        This functional relationship has no closed form.  However,
        the relationship has been established numerically based on
        experimental data.  See <a href="#afp-fd">Figure #aft-fd</a>
        for a schematic diagram of the drag coefficient's dependence
        on the Reynolds number.

<SubSubSubSection title="Quadratic drag model">

    <p>
        Notice from <a href="#afp-fd">Figure #aft-fd</a> that there
        is a range of Reynolds numbers (<InlineEquation equation="10^3 < {\\rm Re} < 10^5" />),
        characteristic of macroscopic projectiles, for which the
        drag coefficient is approximately constant at about 1/2 (see
        the part of the curve labeled “4”
        in <a href="#afp-fd">Figure #aft-fd</a>).  That the drag 
    coefficient is constant means that,
        within this region, the magnitude of the drag force is
        proportional to the square of the object’s speed.
    Substituting <InlineEquation equation="C_{\\rm D}=1/2$ into the definition of $C_{D}"/> above,
        we obtain

        <DisplayEquation equation="F_{\\rm D} = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho A v^2 = c v^2,"/>
      
    where we have defined the <em>quadratic drag parameter</em> $c$ as

        <DisplayEquation equation="c = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho A = \\frac{\pi}{16} \\rho D^2," />

        which is a constant for a given projectile. This is referred to as <em>quadratic
        drag</em>, because the drag force magnitude is proportional
        to the <em>square</em> of the speed.
    Using this result, we can write the drag force vector as
      
        <DisplayEquation equation="\\vec{F}_{\\rm D} = - c v^2 \\hat{v}." />
        
      <p>
      <p>
        In the presence of gravity and quadratic drag alone, the net
        force on an object is given by

        <DisplayEquation equation="\\sum \\vec{F} = m \\vec{g} - c v^2 \\hat{v}," />
        

        where <InlineEquation equation="m" /> is the mass of the object and <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{g}" /> is the
        local acceleration due to gravity. Below is an interactive
        graphic showing the trajectory of an object with gravity and
        quadratic drag.  You can change the various parameters to
        see their effects on the object’s motion.
