          We normally think of our classroom or laboratory as being

          assumption?

      <p>
        We all know that one day is 24 hours long. But the period of
        the Earth's rotation is not 24 hours! This is because of the
        difference between <i>solar time</i> and <i>sidereal
        time</i>. Solar time is the time measured against the Sun,
        as we normally do. Sidereal time is measured against the
        stars, which is slightly different.

          Schematic of the Earth's rotation about its own axis and
          about the sun, counting solar days and sidereal days. Here
          the Earth has just 8 solar days per year for better
          visualization.
        </p>
      </PrairieDrawCanvas>
    
      <p>
        As we can see above, the Earth rotates one more sidereal day
        each year than solar days. This means:
      </p>
      <p>
        <DisplayEquation equation="\\text{1 solar year} = \\text{365 solar days}= \\text{366 sidereal days}" />
      </p>
      <p>
        and so:
      </p>
      <p>
        <DisplayEquation equation="\\begin{aligned}\\text{sidereal day} &amp;= \\frac{365}{366}\\ \\text{solar day} \\\\&amp;= \\frac{365}{366} \\times 24\\ {\\rm h} \\\\&amp;= 23.93{\\rm\\ h} \\\\&amp;= 23{\\rm\\ h}\\ 56{\\rm\\ min}\\end{aligned}" /> 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Earth's orbital angular velocity is thus actually
        <InlineEquation equation="\\omega = 360^\\circ / (23.93{\\rm\\ h}) = 15.04^\\circ/\\rm h" />.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship between solar and sidereal days can also be
        computed by considering just a single day, as shown
        below.

        Just as for the definition of a day, there is a similar
        distinction between the <em>synodic lunar month</em>, which
        is the time between passes of the Moon between the Earth and
        the Sun, and the <em>sidereal lunar month</em>, which is the
        orbital period of the Moon in an inertial frame. In common
        usage, the phrase <em>lunar month</em> refers to the synodic
        month.

          <p>
            Just as sidereal days and solar days are different, the
            exact length of one year depends on how we define it. The
            <em>sidereal year</em> is the time for the Earth to
            complete one orbit relative to the fixed stars, and has
            length 365.256363 solar days. The <em>tropical year</em>
            is the time for the Earth to return to the same point in
            the seasons, which varies around a value of about
            365.242189 solar days (about 20 minutes shorter than the
            sidereal year). These years are different because of the
            <a
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession">axial
            precession</a> of the Earth.
          </p>
          <p class=mb-0>
            In common usage the word “year” refers to the tropical
            year, as the seasons have historically been more important
            for people than the motion of the stars. Observe that:

          <p>
            This is why leap years in our <a
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian
            calendar</a> add an extra day every 4 years, unless the
            year is a whole century, except every 400 years. If our
            calendar used sidereal years instead of tropical, the fact
            that 365.256363 is slightly larger than 365.25 would mean
            that about every 200 years we would need to have a double
            leap year, when there would be two extra days (February
            30?).
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            While leap years occur because the year is not an exact
            integer number of days, a similar problem is caused by the
            fact that the solar day is not exactly 24 × 60 × 60
            seconds. The length of the day actually varies somewhat
            unpredictably due to tidal friction as well as climactic
            and geologic events such as glacier formation and mass
            redistribution in the mantle, both of which change the
            Earth's moment of inertia. To correct for these variations
            a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap
            second</a> is occasionally added, in which the last minute
            of the day has 61 seconds.

    <SubSubSection title="Track transition curves" id="track_transition_curves">
        
        <p>
          For passengers in a car or train, traveling in a straight
          line at constant speed is the most comfortable motion, as
          there is no acceleration. Roads or rail lines with only
          straight lines are rather limiting, however, so we
          frequently encounter curves, in the most extreme form in
          large freeway interchanges such as <a href="#avt-ff">shown
          below</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When designing a freeway interchange, one of the most basic
          questions just what shape the <em>transition curves</em>
          between the straight-line roads should have. Other
          considerations then follow, such as stacking the roads above
          each other and <a href="particle_kinetics#banked_turns">banking</a> the angle of
          the roads.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difficultly in designing curves in roads arises from the
          need to have a smooth ride for the passengers in the
          vehicles as they traverse the curves at high speed. In
          particular, we do not want to have sudden changes in
          acceleration for the passengers.

        segments, but on the semi-circular transition curves the
        acceleration is inwards with magnitude <InlineEquation equation="v^2 / \\rho" />, where
        <InlineEquation equation="\\rho" /> is the radius of curvature. A passenger would thus
        feel no acceleration on the straight segments, but then
        would suddenly feel a large sideways acceleration as the
        vehicle switches to the semi-circles, which would be very
        uncomfortable and potentially dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
        For passenger comfort, we do not want rapid changes in
        acceleration for transition curves. That is, we want a low
        value for the derivative of acceleration with respect to
        time. The derivative of acceleration is known as
        <em>jerk</em>, defined by <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{\\jmath} = \\dot{\\vec{a}}" />
        (for vectors) or <InlineEquation equation="j = \\dot{a} " /> (for scalars). With perfect
        semi-circular ends we see that the jerk is mathematically
        infinite at the transition to the curve, although in reality
        it would just be a very high value as the vehicle would not
        transition to the semi-circle instantaneously.

            While the terms <em>velocity</em> and
            <em>acceleration</em> are standard for the 1st and 2nd
            derivatives of position, the names for higher derivatives
            are not so well-established. While <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics)">jerk</a>
            is often used for the derivative of acceleration (so the
            3rd derivative of position), the terms <em>jolt</em>,
            <em>surge</em>, and <em>lurch</em> are also sometimes
            encountered for this quantity. The derivative of jerk is
            sometimes called <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jounce">jounce</a> (so
            it is the 4th derivative of position). <a
            href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/21/11/006">Another
            suggestion</a> is to refer to the 4th, 5th, and 6th
            derivatives of position as <em>snap</em>,
            <em>crackle</em>, and <em>pop</em>, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jerk and snap have many applications in engineering and
            science. For example, jerk and snap have both been used to
            measure human movement smoothness and diagnose stroke
            patients (Rohrer et al., 2002) while minimizing snap is
            often used as a design principle for quadcopter control
            schemes (Mellinger and Kumar, 2011).
          </p>
          <p>
            Changing accelerations (causing jerk) must result from
            changing forces, due to Newton's second law. Although the
            terminology is also somewhat loose in this case, the
            derivative of force with respect to time is often referred
            to as <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yank_(physics)">yank</a>,
            and the derivative of yank is called <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tug_(physics)">tug</a>
            (the second derivative of force). Third derivatives and
            higher of force are very rarely encountered, and do not
            seem to have any names in common usage.

        Unlike the sudden switch <a href="#rvt-fc">shown above</a>
        from a straight line segment (no curvature) to a curved
        transition curve, we would prefer to have a more gradual
        transition. An example of this is <a href="#rvt-fe">shown
        below</a> with the right-hand transition curves changed to
        use <em>Euler spiral</em> segments, which start curving
        gradually and then increase the curvature the further the
        vehicle moves around the curve, before reversing the process
        on the second half of the curve. Euler spirals are one of
        the common types of <a

            The equation for a spiral with linear curvature variation
            was first derived by the Swiss mathematician <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonard
            Euler</a> in 1744, hence the name <em>Euler spiral</em>
            for this curve. The spiral was then independently
            rediscovered in the late 1800s by civil engineers who were
            unaware of Euler's work and who named the resulting spiral
            the <em>clothoid</em>, which is still a commonly used name
            in traffic engineering. This spiral also arises in the
            study of near-field diffraction in optics, as developed by
            the French engineer <a

    <SubSubSubSection title="Euler spiral equation" id="euler_spiral_equation">
      <p>
        An <em>Euler spiral</em> is a curve for which the
        acceleration magnitude increases at a constant rate as we
        travel along the curve at uniform velocity. Another way to
        say this is that the curvature is a linear function of the
        distance along the curve. To see that this is the same
        thing, we write the acceleration in a <a
        href="rvt.html">tangential/normal basis</a> as  For <DisplayEquation equation=" \\vec{a} =    \\ddot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t + \\kappa v^2 \\, \\hat{e}_n. " />
        constant-speed motion with speed \(v\), the distance along the
        curve satisfies <InlineEquation equation=" \\dot{s} = v = \\text{constant}" />, so
        <InlineEquation equation="\\ddot{s} = 0" />. The acceleration vector thus only has a
        normal component, and this has magnitude proportional to the
        curvature <InlineEquation equation="\\kappa = 1/\\rho" />, where <InlineEquation equation="\\rho" /> is the radius of
        curvature. To have the acceleration increasing linearly
        along the curve, we thus want the curvature to be a linear
        function of distance, so <InlineEquation equation="\\kappa = \\alpha s" /> for some
        constant <InlineEquation equation="\\alpha" />.
      </p>
      <p>
        While specifying that <InlineEquation equation="\\kappa = \\alpha s" /> is enough to
        define the shape of the Euler spiral curve, finding the
        explicit equation for the curve is not so easy. We first
        introduce the functions \(C(z)\) and \(S(z)\), known as <em>Fresnel
        integrals</em> and defined by:
      </p>
    
      <DisplayEquation id="avt-ef" title="Fresnel integrals" background="True" equation="\\begin{aligned}C(z) &amp;= \\int_0^z \\cos\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) du \\\\S(z) &amp;= \\int_0^z \\sin\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) du\\end{aligned}"/>
    
      <p>
        The Fresnel integrals do not have any simpler forms in terms
        of elementary functions, as the integrals in them cannot be
        computed in closed form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we define the constant <InlineEquation equation="\\ell = \\sqrt{\\pi/\\alpha}" />, and
        then the position at distance \(s\) along an Euler spiral
        curve is:
      </p>
    
      <DisplayEquation id="avt-ee" title="Euler spiral"  equation="\\vec{r} = \\ell C(s / \\ell) \\, \\hat{\\imath}+ \\ell S(s / \\ell) \\, \\hat{\\jmath}" background="True" derivation="True">
        <InlineCanvas id="avt-ee-c" width="300" height="200" />
    
        <p>
          We start the spiral curve from the origin, initially
          moving horizontally to the right and curving upwards
          with constant speed \(v\). Using a tangential/normal
          basis, let \(\theta\) be the angle of <InlineEquation equation="\\hat{e}_t" /> as
          shown. Then <InlineEquation equation="\\dot{\\theta}" /> can be found by considering
          two expressions for the acceleration. First, from the tangential/normal acceleration
          formula, we have <DisplayEquation equation=" \\vec{a} = \\ddot{s} \\, \\hat{e}_t +      \\kappa v^2 \\, \\hat{e}_n = \\alpha s v^2 \\, \\hat{e}_n, " />
          where we used the fact that <InlineEquation equation="\\ddot{s} = \\dot{v} = 0" />
          (constant speed) and that <InlineEquation equation="\\kappa = \\alpha s " /> for some
          constant \(\alpha\) (the definition of the Euler spiral is
          that curvature is a linear function of distance \(s\)).
        </p>
        <p>
          The second expression for acceleration uses the angular
          velocity <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{\\omega} = \\dot\\theta \\, \\hat{k}" /> of the
          tangential/normal basis vectors. Recalling that <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{v}      = v \\, \\hat{e}_t" /> and \(v\) is constant, we have
          <DisplayEquation equation=" \\begin{aligned}      \\vec{a} = \\dot{\\vec{v}} = v \\, \\dot{\\hat{e}}_t      = v \\, \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{e}_t      = v \\dot{\\theta} \\, \\hat{e}_n. \\end{aligned}" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparing the two expressions for <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{a}" /> and using <InlineEquation equation="s = vt" /> we see that
          <DisplayEquation equation=" \\dot{\\theta} = \\alpha s v = \\alpha v^2 t " /> and we can
          integrate this (with the initial condition that $\(\theta\)
          starts at zero) to give <DisplayEquation equation=" \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha      v^2 t^2. " />
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the equation for <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{r}" /> we can integrate the
          equation <DisplayEquation equation=" \\dot{\\vec{r}} = v \\, \\hat{e}_t = v      \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{\\imath} + v \\sin\\theta \\,      \\hat{\\jmath} " /> 
          starting from <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{r}=0" /> to obtain 
          
          <DisplayEquation equation="      \\begin{aligned} \\vec{r} &amp;= \\int_0^t \\left(v      \\cos\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha v^2 \\tau^2\\Big) \\,      \\hat{\\imath} + v \\sin\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\alpha v^2 \\tau^2      \\Big) \\, \\hat{\\jmath}\\right) d\\tau \\\\ &amp;= \\ell      \\int_0^{s/\\ell} \\left( \\cos\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big)      \\, \\hat{\\imath} + \\sin\\Big(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi u^2\\Big) \\,      \\hat{\\jmath} \\right) du, \\end{aligned} " />
          
           where we made
          the substitution <InlineEquation equation="\\tau = \\ell u / v" /> with <InlineEquation equation="\\ell =      \\sqrt{\\pi/\\alpha}" />. Using the definitions of the
          <a href="#avt-ef">Fresnel integrals</a> now gives the <a
          href="#avt-ee">desired expression</a>.
        </p>
      </DisplayEquation>
    
      <p>
        Plotting the Euler spiral equation gives the curve below,
        which starts out at the origin with zero curvature, and the
        then has steadily increasing curvature as we move along it.

        The full Euler spiral is unsuitable for track transitions,
        as the curvature increases without limit. Instead, we can
        piece together short segments of the Euler spiral to form
        our transition curve. For example, the right-hand curve in
        the <a href="#rvt-fe">smooth track above</a> is composed of
        two copies of the first quarter-turn of the Euler spiral,
        with one copy flipped upside down. This means the curvature
        starts at zero, increases linearly to a maximum halfway
        around the curve, then decreases linearly again back to zero
        to join the straight segment.
