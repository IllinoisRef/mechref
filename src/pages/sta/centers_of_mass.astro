<SubSection title="Centroid">

<p>
    The centroid denotes the <em>geometric</em> center of an object. When an object is made of a homogeneous material, the centroid and the center of mass are at the same point. If the object has an axis of symmetry, the centroid is on the axis of symmetry. In some cases, the centroid may not be on the object. 
</p>

To solve for the centroid of an object:
<Enumerate>
    <Item>Define your coordinate system</Item>
    <Item>Define the infinitesimally small element (usually \(dL\), \(dA\), or \(dV\))</Item>
    <Item>Express the element in terms of the coordinate system you defined</Item>
    <Item>Identify any symmetry</Item>
    <Item>Define the centroid <InlineEquation equation="(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{y})" />of the element</Item>
    <Item>Plug the equations from 3 and 5 into the equations for the centroid</Item>
</Enumerate>

<p>The equation for the centroid of an object is as follows:</p>

<DisplayEquation equation="\\begin{align} \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\int{\\tilde{x}dV}}{\\int{dV}} \\\\ {\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\int{\\tilde{x}dA}}{\\int{dA}} \\\\ {\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\int{\\tilde{x}dL}}{\\int{dL}} \\end{align}" />

with similar equations for <InlineEquation equation="\\bar{y}" />.
