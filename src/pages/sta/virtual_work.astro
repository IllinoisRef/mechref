A force does work when it produces a displacement along its line of action. 

Virtual work (<InlineEquation equation='dU' />) is the work produced by a force over an infinitesimally small displacement <InlineEquation equation='dr' />.

<DisplayEquation equation='dU = F\\cdot dr\\' />

Virtual work of a couple moment: 

<DisplayEquation equation='dU = \\vec{M}\\cdot d\\theta \\vec{k}\\' />

<Image src='/Statics/VWorkFigures/VWorkCoupleMoment.png' width='5 '> Virtual work  <InlineEquation equation='dU' />  completed by a couple moment,  <InlineEquation equation='M' /> .</Image>

We can use virtual work to solve for the forces in a system without needing to solve for all of the support reactions. For example, if a truss is completely pinned on one end, it doesn't move, which means there is no virtual work completed on that pin because there are no virtual displacements!

<SubSection title="Virtual displacements" id="virtual_displacements">
A virtual displacement is an infinitesimally small displacement (or rotation) that is possible in the system, denoted usually as <InlineEquation equation='dx' /> or <InlineEquation equation='d\\theta' />. It's important to note that virtual displacements are assumed to be possible but don't actually exist.

<SubSection title="Principle of Virtual Work" id="principle_virtual_work">

If a body is in equilibrium, the sum of the virtual work done by all the forces and couple moments acting on the body is zero. 

<DisplayEquation equation="\\sum{dU} = \\sum{\\vec{F}d\\vec{x}} + \\sum{\\vec{M}d\\vec{\\theta}} = 0 " />

<p>Steps for completing an analysis of a system using virtual work: </p>

<!-- %taken from TAM 210 Lecture 34 -->
<Enumerate>
    <Item>Draw a free body diagram of the system, including a coordinate system</Item>
    <Item>Sketch the "deflected" position of the system</Item>
    <Item>Define the position coordinates (measured from a fixed point), select the parallel line of action component, and remove all the forces that do not complete any work </Item>
    <Item>Differentiate the position coordinates to obtain virtual displacement</Item>
    <Item>Write the virtual work equation, expressing the virtual work of every force and moment</Item>
    <Item>Factor out the common virtual displacement term and solve</Item>
</Enumerate>

<!--It might be good to put an example problem here eventually-->
