<Section title="Reaction forces" id="reaction_forces">

Because of Newton's Third Law we know that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. We can solve for these reaction forces to understand the loading of a structure.
  
</Section>
<SubSection title="Types of connections" id="types_of_connections">

Different supports and different connections have different types of reaction forces depending on what they are constraining. For example, a pin connection restricts movement in the x-and y-directions but doesn't restrict rotation. This means that each pin connection has two reaction forces: one in the x-direciton, and one in the y-direction corresponding to the degrees of freedom that are fixed. 

A roller support only constrains movement in the y-direction, and thus only has one reaction force (oriented in the y-direction).

<SubSubSection title="Redundant constraints" id="redundant_constraints">

If a body has more supports than it needs to hold it in equilibrium, it is overly constrained. This will result in more unknown reaction forces than equations we can write, and the problem will not be solvable using statics alone. This type of system is a "statically indeterminate" system. 

In a 2D system, we can write three equilibrium equations (forces in the x and y directions and moments about a point), which means we can solve system with up to three unknowns. 

If a 2D system has 3 or less unknown reaction forces, it is considered determinate. If it has more than three unknown reaction forces, it is considered indeterminate.

<SubSubSection title="Proper and improper constraints" id="proper_constraints">

A system can be properly or improperly constrained under different loading conditions. 

A system is considered <strong>properly constrained</strong> when there is a unique solution to the problem of determining support reactions.

If there are multiple solutions to the problem, then the system is considered <strong>properly constrained with redundancy</strong>. 

If there is no solution, the system is considered to be <strong>improperly constrained</strong> for those specific loading conditions. 

</SubSubSection>

<SubSubSection title="Stability and instability" id="stability">

If a system is stable in statics, it means that it cannot rotate or translate in any direction <strong>under any loading conditions</strong>.

There are three ways we can analyze a 2D system to determine if it is stable or unstable: 

<Enumerate>
	<Item>If there are less than three reaction forces, the system is unstable and considered "underconstrained". </Item>
	<Item>If all of the reaction forces have lines of action that are parallel to each other, the system is unstable for translation. Nothing is preventing the system from moving perpendicular to those lines.</Item>

	<Image src='/sta/reaction_forces/UnstableTranslation.jpg' width='6'>Stable system (left) and unstable system (right).</Image>

	<Item>If all of the reaction forces have lines of action that meet in a single point, nothing is preventing the system from rotating about that point and the system is unstable for rotation at that point. </Item>

<p>
	In track and field, athletes who compete in sprinting events use starting blocks. Essentially, they push off of them in order to assist in acceleration at the beginning of races.
	The reaction force created by the athlete by applying force into the blocks will be normal to the surface of the blocks.
	The following is a heavily abstracted model that aims to show the resultant reaction force generated if a force <InlineEquation equation = "F_B"/> is applied to a back block set at 55 degrees and a force <InlineEquation equation = "F_F"/> is applied to a front block set at 45 degrees.

<p>
	Keep in mind that several assumptions were made in this model and calculation. This model assumes that each force is applied perpendicular to the surface of the block.
	This model also ignores the role that the athlete's spikes (studded shoes used in sprinting) being dug into the turf material on the surface of the block has on the FBD.

<p>
	The angle of the blocks can be adjusted to the athlete's preferences. One may be lead to believe that setting the blocks to the most vertical angle, maximizing the horizontal reaction force, would be best.
	However, the opposite is actually true. <a target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" href = "https://www.brianmac.co.uk/sprints/blockset.htm">This</a> article explains how lower angles actually increase the usage of the athlete's stretch reflex.
	Typically, the front block is set to about 45 degrees and the back block is set to a more vertical position.
	This is to achieve a front knee angle of about 90 degrees and a back knee angle of about 120 degrees. <a target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" href = "https://outperformsports.com/block-starts-for-track/">This</a> study explores the implications of different back knee angles.
	Essentially, athletes aim to get into what is called "triple extension," which is when the ankles, knees, and hips are as open as possible, maximizing the power output from their muscles.
	Here is an example of starting blocks being used at the <a target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_t6CbKsGo">Paris Olympics.</a>
