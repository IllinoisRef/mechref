        Cartesian coordinates (also known as rectangular
        coordinates) are the regular \(x,y\) or \(x,y,z\) coordinates in
        2D and 3D, with perpendicular straight-line axes.

                When writing coordinates we can either list the coordinate
                values explicitly, like \(x = 2\), \(y = 1\), or we can just
                write the numbers in an ordered list, like \( (2,
                1) \).
              </p>
              <p>
                Writing them as a list assumes that we know which
                coordinate system we are using, and which order the
                coordinates are in. We will typically write the coordinate
                values explicitly to avoid confusion. This also applies to
                <a href="rvv.html#rvv-ic">vector components</a>.

<SubSection title="Vector bases" id="vector_bases">

    <p>
        To describe vectors mathematically, we write them as a
        combination of <em>basis vectors</em>. An <em>orthonormal
        basis</em> is a set of two (in 2D) or three (in 3D) basis
        vectors which are <em>orthogonal</em> (have 90Â°
        angles between them) and <em>normal</em> (have length equal
        to one). We will not be using non-orthogonal or non-normal
        bases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any other vector can be written as a <em>linear
        combination</em> of the basis vectors:

        The numbers \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) are called the
        <em>components</em> of <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{a}" /> in the <InlineEquation equation="\\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\hat{\\jmath}, \\hat{k}" /> basis. If we are in 2D then we will
        only have two components for a vector.

<SubSection title="Right hand rule" id="right_hand_rule">

The Cartesian system is a "right-handed" coordinate system, which means that we can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the <InlineEquation equation='x, y' /> and <InlineEquation equation='z' /> axes. 

In 3D the <InlineEquation equation='x, y, z' /> axes are oriented in right-handed order, so that fingers curling from <InlineEquation equation='x' /> to <InlineEquation equation='y' /> means the thumb points in the <InlineEquation equation='z' /> direction.

We can also use the individual fingers on our right hand, where our pointer finger points in the x-direction, our middle finger points in the y-direction, and our thumb points in the z-direction.
