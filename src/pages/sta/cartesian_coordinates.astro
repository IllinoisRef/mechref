        Some textbooks differentiate between <em>free
        vectors</em>, which are free to slide around, and
        <em>bound vectors</em>, which are anchored in space. We
        will only use free vectors.

        We will use the over-arrow notation <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{a}" /> for vector
        quantities. Other common notations include bold
        <InlineEquation equation="\\boldsymbol{a}" /> and under-bars <InlineEquation equation="\\underline{a}" />. For unit
        (length one) vectors we will use an over-hat <InlineEquation equation="\\hat{a}" />.

                When writing coordinates we can either list the coordinate
                values explicitly, like \(x = 2\), \(y = 1\), or we can just
                write the numbers in an ordered list, like \( (2,

                Writing them as a list assumes that we know which
                coordinate system we are using, and which order the
                coordinates are in. We will typically write the coordinate
                values explicitly to avoid confusion. This also applies to

    <p>
      To describe vectors mathematically, we write them as a
      combination of <em>basis vectors</em>. An <em>orthonormal
      basis</em> is a set of two (in 2D) or three (in 3D) basis
      vectors which are <em>orthogonal</em> (have 90°
      angles between them) and <em>normal</em> (have length equal
      to one). We will not be using non-orthogonal or non-normal
      bases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any other vector can be written as a <em>linear
      combination</em> of the basis vectors:
    </p>

    <DisplayEquation id="rvv-ec" title="Components of a vector." background=True equation="\\vec{a} = a_1 \\,\\hat{\\imath}+ a_2 \\,\\hat{\\jmath} + a_3 \\,\\hat{k}"/>

    <p>
      The numbers \(a_1, a_2, a_3\) are called the
      <em>components</em> of <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{a}" /> in the <InlineEquation equation="\\,\\hat{\\imath}, \\hat{\\jmath}, \\hat{k}" /> basis. If we are in 2D then we will
      only have two components for a vector.

          The use of the letter \(i,j,k\) for basis vectors is due to

          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton">William
          Hamilton</a>, who was motivated by thinking of basis
          vectors as extensions of the complex number \(i\). This
          notation was popularized by the book <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Analysis_(Gibbs/Wilson)"><i>Vector
          Analysis: A Text Book for the Use of Students of
          Mathematics and Physics Founded upon the Lectures of
          J. Willard Gibbs</i></a> (1901), by <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Bidwell_Wilson">E. B. Wilson</a>. This
          book also introduced the use of bold letters to represent

<SubSubSection title="Length of vectors">
  <p>
    The length of a vector <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{a}" /> is written
    either <InlineEquation equation="\\| \\vec{a} \\|" /> or just plain \(a\). The
    length can be computed using <em>Pythagorus’
    theorem</em>:
  </p>

  <DisplayEquation id="rvv-ey" title="Pythagorus' length formula." background=True derivation=True equation="a = \\|\\vec{a}\\|            = \\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}">
    <p>
      First we prove Pythagorus' theorem for right-angle
      triangles. For side lengths \(a\) and \(b\) and hypotenuse
      \(c\), the fact that \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) can be seen
      graphically below, where the gray area is the same before
      and after the triangles are rotated in the animation:

    </Center>

    <p>
      Pythagorus' theorem immediately gives us vector lengths
      in 2D.  To find the length of a vector in 3D we can use
      Pythagorus' theorem twice, as shown below. This gives
      the two right-triangle calculations:

      <DisplayEquation equation="\\begin{aligned}      \\ell^2 &amp;= a_1^2 + a_2^2 \\\\      a^2 &amp;= \\ell^2 + a_3^2 = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2.      \\end{aligned}" />

<SubSection title="Right Hand Rule">

The Cartesian system is a "right-handed" coordinate system, which means that we can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the <InlineEquation equation='x, y' /> and <InlineEquation equation='z' /> axes. In 3D the <InlineEquation equation='x, y, z' /> axes are oriented in right-handed order, so that fingers curling from <InlineEquation equation='x' /> to <InlineEquation equation='y' /> means the thumb points in the <InlineEquation equation='z' /> direction.
