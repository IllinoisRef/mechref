<SubSubSection title="Vectors">

<BlueText>From TAM212 Reference Pages (Vectors and Bases):</BlueText>

A <em>vector</em> is an arrow with a length and a direction. Just like positions, vectors exist before we measure or describe them. Unlike positions, vectors can mean many different things, such as position vectors, velocities, etc. Vectors are not anchored to particular positions in space, so we can slide a vector around and locate it at any position.

<SubSubSection title="Scalars">

While a vector represents magnitude and direction, a <em>scalar</em> is a number that represents a magnitude, but with no directional information. Some examples of scalar quantities can be mass, length, time, speed, or temperature.

<SubSubSection title="Scaling Vectors">

<BlueText>Taken from TAM212 Reference Pages (Vectors and Bases)</BlueText>

Vectors can be multiplied by a scalar number, which multiplies their length.

</SubSubSection>

<SubSubSection title="Vector Addition and Subtraction">

<BlueText>From TAM212 Reference Pages (Vectors and Bases):</BlueText>

Vectors can be added or subtracted together, using the parallelogram law of addition or the head-to-tail rule.

</SubSection>

<SubSection title="Vector Magnitude and Direction">

Vectors can be written as a magnitude (length) multiplied by the unit vector in the same direction as the original vector. 

<DisplayEquation equation='\\vec{A} = \\|\\vec{A}\\|  \\hat{u_A}\\' />

<BlueText>Insert the same content here as from the TAM212 Reference Pages (Vectors and Bases - Length of Vectors) for vector magnitude.</BlueText>

The direction of a vector can be written as a unit vector by dividing the vector components by the vector magnitude.

Alternatively, the vector components can be determined geometrically via the angles of each component with respect to the Cartesian coordinates. 

<BlueText>Can probably make some sort of interactive figure here based on the image from TAM 210 lecture notes - slide 4</BlueText>
