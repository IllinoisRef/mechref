<SubSection title="Newton's Laws">


<p>
    Newton's equations relate the acceleration <InlineEquation equation='\\vec{a}' /> of a point mass with mass <InlineEquation equation='m' /> to the total applied force <InlineEquation equation='\\vec{F}' /> on the mass (sum of all applied forces).
</p>

<p>
    There is no derivation for Newton's equations, because they are an assumed model for dynamics. We can only verify them by comparing with experimental evidence, which confirms that Newtonian dynamics are accurate for non-relativistic and non-quantum systems.

<SubSubSection title="Newton's First Law">

A particle at rest stays that way unless acted on by unbalanced forces.

    <DisplayEquation equation="\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}" background="True" title="Newton's second law: "/>

</SubSubSection>

<SubSubSection title="Newton's Third Law">

The mutual forces of action and reaction between two particles are equal, opposite, and collinear.

                 The three laws of motion were first stated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a>
                 in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophiæ_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica">Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</a>
                 (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), originally
                 published in 1687. By the time Newton wrote the Principia, he
                 had already developed calculus (which he called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxion" title="Fluxion">the science of fluxions</a>"), but in the
                 Principia he made no explicit use of it, perhaps because he believed geometrical arguments to be more rigorous. Consequently, the
                 Principia does not express acceleration as the second
                 derivative of position, and so it does not give the second law
                 as <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}"/>. This form of the second law was written (for the
                 special case of constant force) at least as early as 1716, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Hermann" title="Jakob Hermann">Jakob Hermann</a>

<SubSubSection title="Particles">
<!-- Could change this section to "Idealizations" and write about particle idealizations, rigid body assumptions, and concentrated / distributed force assumptions.  -->

In this course, we assume two things about particles: 

<ol>
	<li>The mass of the particle is not 0.</li>
	<li>The radius of the mass is 0.</li>
</ol>


 Through these assumptions, we are essentially concentrating all of the mass of an object at a single point in space. The particle has a mass but the size and shape of the particle is not taken into account. 

</SubSubSection>

<SubSubSection title="Rigid Bodies">

For rigid bodies, we assume that the object has both mass (similar to particles) but also take its shape into account. 

We call these bodies "rigid" because we assume that they do not deform under applied forces or moments. 

A <em>rigid body</em> is an extended area of material that
          includes all the points inside it, and which moves so that
          the distances and angles between all its points remain
          constant. The location of a rigid body can be described by
          the position of one point \(P\) inside it, together with the
          rotation angle of the body (one angle in 2D, three angles in
          3D).

    <p>
        Neither point masses nor rigid bodies can physically exist,
        as no body can really be a single point with no extent, and
        no extended body can be exactly rigid. Despite this, these
        are very useful models for mechanics and dynamics.
