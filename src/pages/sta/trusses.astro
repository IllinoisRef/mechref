<Section title="Trusses">

<p>Trusses are support members that are joined together at the ends. The function of a truss is to transmit loads to a support joint. In this section, we will analyze a simplified version of planar trusses called simple trusses, which consist of two-force members connected by frictionless joints/pins.

<!-- Definition of a truss -->

<SubSection title="Truss Assumptions">

The main assumptions for trusses and truss structures are:
<Enumerate>
	<Item>All loading is applied at the joints.</Item>
	<Item>The weight of the truss is negligible.</Item>
</Enumerate>
<p>
Because of these assumptions, all trusses are <em>two force members</em>, with the forces on the truss acting along the axis of the member. 
</p>

<SubSection title="Two Force Member">
<p>
A two force member is a rigid body that has two forces (no moments) acting on it in two locations, say \(A\) and \(B\). <RedText> Nikhil's Comment: Equilibrium of the two-force member implies</RedText></p>
	
<DisplayEquation equation="\\vec{F_A} + \\vec{F_B} = \\vec 0," />

<RedText>resulting in</RedText>
<Enumerate>
	<Item>\(|F_A| = |F_B|\)</Item>
	<Item><InlineEquation equation="\\vec{F_A}" /> and <InlineEquation equation="\\vec{F_B}" /> act along the same line of action.</Item>
</Enumerate>

<SubSection title="Zero Force Member">

Zero force members are members in a truss structure that experience no force. They act as support trusses to add stability, but are not load bearing. There are 2 cases where zero force members occur: 
<Enumerate>
	<Item> Two noncolinear members share a pin with no support or external forces (Zero force member example, left)
    </Item>
	<Item> Two colinear forces with a third noncolinear force on a pin (zero force member example, right)
</Item>
</Enumerate>

<BlueText>Insert content here from TAM 212 reference page - Free Body Diagrams - Rigid Bodies - Trusses section. This has a really good analysis of eliminating zero force members to simplify the structure</BlueText>

</SubSection>

<!-- lecture 18 -->

<SubSection title="Truss Analysis: Joints">

Method of joints for truss analysis: 
<Enumerate>
	<Item>Draw a free-body diagram for the entire truss and solve for the external reaction forces and moments at the supports</Item>
	<Item>Draw a free-body diagram of a joint with at least 1 known force and at most two unknown forces</Item>
	<Item>Use the equations of equilibrium for the joint to solve for the unknown forces</Item>
	<Item>Repeat steps 2 and 3 to find the forces in the trusses you are interested in. </Item>
</Enumerate>

<p><em>Note:</em> Remember that truss members that are in compression "push back" on the pin joints, and truss members that are in tension "pull" on the pin joints.
