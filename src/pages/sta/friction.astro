<p>
Friction is a force that resists the movement of two contacting surfaces sliding relative to each other. Frictional forces act tangential to the surface at the point of contact and act in opposition to the possible or existing motion between the surfaces.

	Variables <b> <InlineEquation equation=" F "/> </b> and <b> <InlineEquation equation=" N "/> </b> are the magnitude of the friction for <b> <InlineEquation equation=" \\vec{F} "/> </b> and the normal force <b> <InlineEquation equation=" \\vec{N} "/> </b>, and <b> <InlineEquation equation=" \\mu "/> </b> is the coefficient of friction.

<!--This might be a good place to add practical examples - maybe how engine brakes use friction? And another thing about how cartilage in your joints has very little friction (like ice on ice!) which allows for joint movement.-->

In TAM 210/211, we will focus on dry friction. Dry friction occurs between two surfaces with <strong>no</strong> lubricating fluid between them. 

Static friction is the friction between two bodies when there is no movement between them.

To solve for X (the location of the normal force), one can write the equations of equilibrium.

<em>Note:</em> See below for an explanation of why the normal force does not act at the center of mass of the box.
