<!-- Lecture 30, 31, 32 -->
<strong>Pascal's Law:</strong> A fluid at rest creates a pressure point <em>p</em> at a point that is the same in all directions.

<SubSection title="Fluid Pressure">

For an incompressible fluid (density <InlineEquation equation='\\rho' />) at rest, the pressure <InlineEquation equation='p' /> varies linearly with fluid depth <InlineEquation equation='z' />. This means that the pressure along a horizontal plane (at a certain depth <InlineEquation equation='z' /> is constant.

The fluid pressure <InlineEquation equation='P(z)' /> can be written as: 

<DisplayEquation equation='P(z) = \\rho*g*z\\' />

<SubSection title="Buoyancy">

<strong>Archimedes' Principle:</strong> Any object that is either partially or totally immersed in a fluid has a buoyancy force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
