<!-- Lecture 30, 31, 32 -->
<p> <strong>Pascal's Law:</strong> A fluid at rest creates a pressure point <em>p</em> at a point that is the same in all directions. 
</p>

<p><strong>Hydrostatic Fluid Pressure:</strong> Hydrostatic fluid pressure refers to the pressure from a fluid that is at rest (the "static" part of hydrostatic). It comes from the force of gravity acting on the fluid. 
</p>

<SubSection title="Fluid Pressure" id="fluid_pressure">

For an incompressible fluid (density <InlineEquation equation='\\rho' />) at rest, the pressure <InlineEquation equation='P' /> varies linearly with fluid depth <InlineEquation equation='z' />. This means that the pressure along a horizontal plane (at a certain depth <InlineEquation equation='z' /> is constant.

<Warning title="Make sure you don't confuse pressure with force!" id="force-pressure">
    <p>
      Pressure is a force distributed over an area (force per area) and therefore has units of Pascals (Pa). To calculate the resultant force from hydrostatic fluid pressure, you must use  
    </p>

	<DisplayEquation equation="F_R = P*A"/>

	<p> Where <InlineEquation equation=" A " /> is the area that the force is applied over.

<SubSection title="Pressure, Distributed Loads, and Free Body Diagrams" id="fluid_pressure_FBD">

<p> Hydrostatic fluid pessure is a type of distributed load. If you need a refresher on distributed loads, see the <a href="https://www.mechref.org/sta/force_systems/?origin=sidebar#distributed_loads">Distributed Loads Reference Page</a>.

<p>
Given a plate submerged in water, we can choose to draw the FBD of the plate in 2D or 3D:
</p>

<p>
In 3D, the value for <InlineEquation equation=" w " />, the distributed load on the plate from the fluid, is just the pressure <InlineEquation equation=" P " /> at depth <InlineEquation equation=" h " />. To solve for the resultant force from the distributed load we multiply by the area of the plate. 
</p>

<p>
In 2D, the the value for <InlineEquation equation=" w " />, the distributed load on the plate from the fluid, is the pressure <InlineEquation equation=" P " /> at depth <InlineEquation equation=" h " /> <strong> multiplied by the plate depth <InlineEquation equation=" b " />. </strong> To solve for the resultant force from the distributed load we multiply by the length of the plate.

<SubSection title="Fluid Pressure with Slanted and Curved Surfaces" id="fluid_pressure_FBD">

<p> We will often be required to analyze the hdrostatic fluid pressure on surfaces that are not perfectly horizontal or vertical. In these cases, it is often easier to redraw our system and create articifial horizontal and vertical "surfaces", adding the force from the FBD of the weight of the water trapped in our horizontal and vertical surfaces. 
</p>

<p> This method will result in the same resultant force on the slanted surface, but the distributed loads are easier to calculate. 
</p>

<p> Using this method, we can solve for the resultant force by calculating the total horizontal forces (<InlineEquation equation=" F_H " />) and vertical forces (<InlineEquation equation=" F_V " />) and relating them using </p>

<p>
<strong>Archimedes' Principle:</strong> Any object that is either partially or totally immersed in a fluid has a buoyancy force <InlineEquation equation=" F_B " /> equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object (<InlineEquation equation=" W_{Displaced} " />).
